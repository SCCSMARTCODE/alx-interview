## Introduction

The N-Queen Problem Solver script implements an algorithm to find all possible solutions for the N-Queen problem. It can solve the problem for any given value of N, where N is greater than 3.

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script with the desired value of N as a command-line argument. For example:


This command will find all possible solutions for the 8-Queen problem and display them.

Please note that the script assumes valid input, where N is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4. Providing invalid input may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
